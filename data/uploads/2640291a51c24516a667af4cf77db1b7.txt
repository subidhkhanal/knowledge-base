Also coming up tomorrow: Q2 (Transformers) and Q4 (response.text vs .json())

Let's start! Here's your first question:

Q8 — Python Basics ⭐

What does type() return for each variable?

python
a = 10
b = 3.14
c = "hello"
d = [1, 2, 3]
e = {"key": "value"}
f = (1, 2)
g = True
h = None
Give me the type for each one.

int
float
string
list
dict
tuple
bool
emptyvalue
11 Feb
Almost perfect! 7/8 correct. Two notes:

c = "hello" → The exact Python type is str, not string. Minor, but in an interview saying str shows you know Python's actual type names.

h = None → ❌ This is NoneType, not "emptyvalue." None is Python's special singleton object representing the absence of a value. It's its own type:

python
>>> type(None)
<class 'NoneType'>
None is not empty string "", not 0, not False — it's a distinct object. You'll see it a lot as default return values from functions and as placeholder values.

Q11 — Python Basics ⭐⭐

Given this list:

python
nums = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80]
Write the slice for each:

Get the first 3 elements
Get the last 3 elements
Get everything except the first and last
Reverse the entire list
Get every other element (10, 30, 50, 70)
nums = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80]
print(nums[:3])
print(nums[-3:])
print(nums[1:-1])
print(nums[::-1])
print(nums[::2])

Q15 — Python Basics ⭐

Dictionary basics — do each of these:

Create a dictionary with keys "name", "age", "city" and any values
Access the value of "name"
Add a new key "email" with a value
Change "city" to "Kathmandu"
Delete the "age" key
new = {
    "name":"Subidh",
    "age": 26,
    "city": "Noida"
}
print(new["name"])
new["email"] = "no@gmail.com"
new["city"] = "kathmandu"
new.pop(new["age"])
print(new)

11 Feb
4/5 correct! One mistake on the delete:

Line 7: new.pop(new["age"]) ❌

This evaluates new["age"] first, which gives 26. So you're actually calling new.pop(26) — trying to delete a key called 26, which doesn't exist. That would throw a KeyError.

Correct ways to delete:

python
new.pop("age")       # returns the removed value (26)
del new["age"]       # deletes in place, returns nothing
Both work. pop is useful when you want to use the deleted value, del when you just want it gone.

Q15 updated: interval → 3 days, due Feb 14, ease 2.65 ✅

Q20 — Python Basics ⭐

String splitting:

python
text = "apple, banana, cherry, date"
Split by comma to get a list of fruits
Get just the third fruit from that list
Now try this: "hello   world   python" — split it so extra spaces don't create empty strings
text = "apple, banana, cherry, date"
new = text.split(",")
# print(new[2])
text2 = "hello   world   python"
new2 = text2.split()
print(new2)

11 Feb
All 3 correct! One thing worth knowing for interviews:

#1: text.split(",") gives ['apple', ' banana', ' cherry', ' date'] — notice the leading spaces on banana, cherry, date. If an interviewer asks for clean output, you'd want:

python
text.split(", ")        # split by ", " instead
# or
[x.strip() for x in text.split(",")]  # strip each item
#3: Using split() with no arguments is the perfect answer — it splits on any whitespace and ignores extras.

Q20 updated: interval → 3 days, due Feb 14, ease 2.65 ✅

Q9 — Python Coding ⭐⭐

Write a function check_age(age) that:

Returns "Invalid" if age is not an integer or is negative
Returns "Minor" if age < 18
Returns "Adult" if age is 18 or above
Use guard clauses (handle bad inputs first, then the main logic).

def check_age(age):
    if type(age) != "int" or age <0:
        print("invalid")
    elif age < 18:
        print("minor")
    else:
        print("adult")

age = input("Enter the age")
check_age(age)

11 Feb
Logic structure is good — guard clause first, then the main checks. But a few issues:

1. Type check is wrong ❌

python
type(age) != "int"  # comparing to a STRING "int"
type(age) returns <class 'int'>, not the string "int". This will ALWAYS be True, so every input hits "invalid."

Fix:

python
if not isinstance(age, int) or age < 0:
isinstance() is preferred over type() in interviews because it also handles subclasses (e.g., bool is a subclass of int).

2. print vs return ❌ The question said "returns." In interviews, functions should return values, not print them. This matters because with print, the caller can't use the result.

3. input() always returns a string ⚠️ So check_age(age) would always receive a string like "25", never an int. You'd need:

python
age = int(input("Enter the age: "))
But then that itself could crash — which is a good place for try/except (you'll cover that in Q24).

Q9 updated: interval → 2.5 days, due Feb 13, ease 2.50 ✅

Q3 — Python Coding ⭐⭐

Write a function extract_names(people) that takes a list of dictionaries and returns a list of all the "name" values.

python
people = [
    {"name": "Alice", "age": 30},
    {"name": "Bob", "age": 25},
    {"name": "Charlie", "age": 35}
]

# Expected output: ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]

Now back to your question, Subidh:

Q3 — Python Coding ⭐⭐

    event_type = data.get("event", "unknown")

    if event_type == "call_completed":

    return result in this code why didnot we simily did data["caller_name","N/A"] will that doesnot work?

12 Feb
Great question! No, data["caller_name", "N/A"] would not work. Here's why:

data["caller_name", "N/A"] — This creates a tuple ("caller_name", "N/A") as the key. Python sees the comma inside brackets as a tuple, so it's actually doing data[("caller_name", "N/A")]. That key doesn't exist, so you get a KeyError.

data["caller_name"] — This works IF the key exists. But if "caller_name" is missing, it crashes with KeyError.

data.get("caller_name", "N/A") — This is the safe way. It tries to find the key, and if it's missing, returns the default value "N/A" instead of crashing.

Quick demo:

python
data = {"name": "Alice"}

data["name"]              # ✅ "Alice"
data["phone"]             # ❌ KeyError
data.get("phone", "N/A")  # ✅ "N/A" (safe fallback)
data["phone", "N/A"]      # ❌ KeyError — looking for tuple key
In interview code, always use .get() when a key might be missing — especially with external API data where you can't guarantee every field will be present.

Now let's get back to Q3 — write extract_names(people):

python
people = [
    {"name": "Alice", "age": 30},
    {"name": "Bob", "age": 25},
    {"name": "Charlie", "age": 35}
]

# Expected output: ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]

            "status": "failed"
        }
    else:

Q40 added and pushed! 🔒 Locked — requires Q4, Q6, and Q24.

Your bank is now at 40 questions. Three new ones added this session (Q38, Q39, Q40) — all API integration focused.

Now, back to Q3 — still waiting on this one 😄

Write extract_names(people):

python
people = [
    {"name": "Alice", "age": 30},
    {"name": "Bob", "age": 25},
    {"name": "Charlie", "age": 35}
]

# Expected output: ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
add this question too "We have a simple patient database (just a list of dicts). Build a function search_patients(patients, **filters) that takes the patient list and any number of keyword filters, and returns only patients that match ALL the filters.
python

patients = [
    {"name": "Alice", "age": 34, "city": "SF", "insurance": "Aetna"},
    {"name": "Bob", "age": 45, "city": "NYC", "insurance": "BlueCross"},
    {"name": "Charlie", "age": 34, "city": "SF", "insurance": "BlueCross"},
    {"name": "Diana", "age": 29, "city": "LA", "insurance": "Aetna"},

It should work like this:
python

search_patients(patients, city="SF")

Q41 added and pushed! 🔒 Locked — requires Q15 (dict basics) and Q9 (guard clauses). Bank is now at 41 questions.

Subidh, that's 4 questions added this session. Let's keep the practice momentum going — Q3 is still on deck:

Write extract_names(people):

python
people = [
    {"name": "Alice", "age": 30},
    {"name": "Bob", "age": 25},
    {"name": "Charlie", "age": 35}
]

# Expected output: ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
what is the difference between .get("phone","n/a") and .get("phone")

12 Feb
Both try to find the key "phone" in the dictionary. The difference is what happens when the key doesn't exist:

.get("phone", "N/A") → returns "N/A" as the fallback

.get("phone") → returns None (the default fallback when you don't specify one)

python
data = {"name": "Alice"}

data.get("phone", "N/A")   # "N/A"
data.get("phone")           # None
Use the two-argument version when you want a meaningful default (like "N/A", 0, []). Use the one-argument version when you're okay with None — for example, when checking if a key exists:

python
if data.get("phone"):
    # do something with phone
Now — Q3 is waiting for you! Write extract_names(people). 😄

ok, let us do q3

12 Feb
Go for it! Here it is again:

python
people = [
    {"name": "Alice", "age": 30},
    {"name": "Bob", "age": 25},
    {"name": "Charlie", "age": 35}
]

# Expected output: ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
Write extract_names(people).

people = [
    {"name": "Alice", "age": 30},
    {"name": "Bob", "age": 25},
    {"name": "Charlie", "age": 35}
]
# Expected output: ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
person = []
for item in people:
    person.append(item["name"])

print(person)

12 Feb
Correct! Clean and clear logic. 💯

One thing — in interviews, you could also write this as a one-liner using list comprehension:

python
person = [item["name"] for item in people]
Both approaches are valid. The loop version shows clear thinking, the comprehension version shows you know Pythonic style. Worth having both in your toolkit.

Also, since this is a function question, wrapping it would be even better:

python
def extract_names(people):
    return [item["name"] for item in people]

Q3 updated: interval → 3 days, due Feb 14, ease 2.65 ✅

Q24 — Error Handling ⭐

Write a program that:

Asks the user for a number using input()
Doubles it and prints the result
If they enter something that's not a number, catch the error and print "Please enter a valid number"
i forgot, i thought the syntax was notainstance or ainstance, what was that?

12 Feb
It's isinstance() — "is instance."

python
isinstance(age, int)       # Is age an instance of int?
isinstance(name, str)      # Is name an instance of str?
isinstance(data, dict)     # Is data an instance of dict?
And to check if something is NOT a certain type:

python
not isinstance(age, int)   # Is age NOT an int?
You can also check multiple types at once:

python
isinstance(x, (int, float))   # Is x either int or float?
Now, Q24 — get a number from the user, double it, handle invalid input with try/except.

number = input("Enter a number")
print(type(number))
print(isinstance(number,int))
if isinstance(number,int):
    print(2*number)
else:
    print("Please enter a valid number")

12 Feb
Good thought process, but there's a fundamental problem:

input() ALWAYS returns a string. So isinstance(number, int) will always be False, and every input hits "Please enter a valid number" — even "42".

Also, the question specifically asked for try/except, not isinstance. Here's why try/except is the right tool here:

python
number = input("Enter a number: ")
try:
    number = int(number)      # try converting string → int
    print(2 * number)
except ValueError:
    print("Please enter a valid number")
The pattern is: try the risky operation (converting to int), and if it fails, except catches the specific error. int("hello") throws ValueError, int("42") works fine.

This is called EAFP — "Easier to Ask Forgiveness than Permission." Instead of checking first (isinstance), you just try it and handle failure. This is the Pythonic way and what interviewers want to see.

Your approach (checking type first) is called LBYL — "Look Before You Leap." It works in some cases, but not here because input() always gives a string.
